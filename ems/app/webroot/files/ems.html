<div class="hori_div_area">Environmental Management Systems (EMS) are management tools that if designed and implemented properly can be extremely valuable in providing an organization with a system to manage its environmental liabilities and risks, reduce pollution, maintain regulatory compliance, and continually improve its environmental performance.  It also provides a means of effective record keeping and training guidelines, and documenting an organization's overall environmental efforts as well as the effectiveness of specific programs. An effective EMS is integrated into an organization's overall business goals, strategies, and mission, and therefore should also improve an organization's overall effectiveness.  Often, an EMS can be effectively integrated into other management systems and programs that an organization may have, such as Quality Management and Social Management Systems.  An EMS if properly designed and implemented is also an effective self management tool that may reduce the need of outside regulatory monitoring.  There are internationally accredited EMS standards, such as ISO 14001. At present, there are no regulatory requirements in Bangladesh for an organization to develop an EMS, however, certain buyers may make this requirement from their manufacturers.<br><br></div>

  <p><strong>Key Elements of an EMS </strong></p>
  <p>Facilities that have the potential to degrade or pollute the environment (e.g. soil, water, air) through their operations and activities should consider EMS as an effective management tool to reduce their environmental risks and improve their environmental performance and overall operational efficiency. Major steps and activities for establishing an EMS may include the following (adopted and modified from NSF 2001): </p>
  <p><u>Environmental  Policy: </u><br>
The Environmental policy should provide  an overview of the organization’s environmental commitments. The policy  statement should include at minimum the following commitments:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Continuous improvement in addressing  environmental management issues;</li>
    <li>Pollution prevention and energy  efficiency, and</li>
    <li>Compliance with relevant laws &amp;  regulations</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="hori_div_area"><br><br>
  <p><u>Environmental  Planning:</u></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Environmental planning should identify the  environmental aspects and impacts of an organization’s activities and  processes. Environmental aspects may include: </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Energy  use</li>
      <li>Chemical  and hazardous materials use</li>
      <li>Water  consumption</li>
      <li>Wastewater  production</li>
      <li>Solid  and hazardous waste generation</li>
      <li>Sewage </li>
      <li>Air  emission</li>
      <li>Sound/noise</li>
      <li>Waste  disposal</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Identify relevant laws and regulations  that the facility needs to comply with;</li>
    <li>Identify and establish environmental  objectives and targets (i.e. numerical targets that can be achieved and  measured)  in line with the environmental  policy and its environmental aspects and impacts; </li>
    <li>Establish an environmental management  program including the necessary actions to achieve enunciated objectives and  targets of the facility (e.g. reducing energy consumption by 10% by adopting a  specific energy reduction program).</li>
  </ul>
  <br><br> </div>


<div class="hori_div_area">
  <p><u>Implementation  and Operation</u></p>
  <p>Implementation and operation activities  include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Establishing roles and responsibilities  for environmental management and provide appropriate resources;</li>
    <li>Train facility staff so that they are  aware of the facility’s overall environmental commitment as well as their own  activities to improve environmental performance; </li>
    <li>Establish processes for the facility  for internal and external communications on environmental issues;</li>
    <li>Record environmental management  information and data;</li>
    <li>Ensure document control to effectively  manage procedures and other system documents; </li>
    <li>Ensure operational control through  identifying, planning and managing operations and activities in line with  policy, objectives and targets;</li>
    <li>Identify potential hazards and develop  procedures for preventing and responding to them during an incident.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><u>Monitoring  and Corrective Actions</u></p>
  <p>Monitoring and corrective activities  include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Monitor  and measure key activities and track performance; </li>
    <li>Identify  non-compliance issues and undertake corrective measures to prevent their reoccurrence;</li>
    <li>Maintain  and manage records of EMS  performance;</li>
    <li>Conduct  audit to periodically verify that the EMS is operating as intended.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><u>Management  Review</u></p>
  <p>Management review activities include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Review EMS activities and performance on at  least an annual basis with an eye to continual improvement of the program;</li>
    <li>Establish new planning targets and  goals as appropriate to drive continuous improvement.  </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>EMS</strong><strong> Certification Process</strong></p>
  <p>An organization may develop and  implement an EMS  but not seek international certification. However, in many cases, a third party  accredited internationally certified EMS, such as ISO 14001, may bring many  advantages and benefits.   </p>
  <p>ISO 14001 provides a framework for a  holistic, strategic and systematic approach towards addressing an  organization’s environmental management goals. ISO 14001 certification or another  internationally accredited EMS (such as the Eco-Management  and Audit Scheme, EMAS certification) is well-recognized by international  buyers, regulatory agencies and the customers. This may result in helping a  company achieve better business goals as well as a healthy working environment. </p>
  <p><strong>EMS</strong><strong> Registration</strong></p>
  <p>An  EMS  can be registered in accordance with international standards, such as ISO  14001. An ISO 14001 registration may be important for facilities to demonstrate  to their buyers that their environmental management standards act in line with  the best international practices.</p>
