<div class="hori_div_area">The first and most important step towards mitigating environmental risks is to eliminate or at least reduce pollutants at the source.  This can be realized through a variety of means including the substitution of more benign materials for toxic materials in an industrial process, through the use of non toxic cleaning agents or solvents, through the use of water based paints, and the use of non toxic adhesives. Furthermore, many of these sorts of substitutions can be cost effective and result in lower production and operation costs.  In addition to material substitution, energy efficiency efforts also result in lower overall pollution levels, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and lower production and operation costs. Energy efficiency efforts may include production process modifications as well as better housekeeping efforts such as more energy efficient lighting fixtures, reduced lighting needs, and energy efficient appliances and equipment such as air conditioners and power generators.<br><br></div>




<div class="hori_div_area">

<div class="cleaner_production_txt"><br>More efficient building design (i.e., green building design) may also reduce the overall energy requirements of an enterprise.  Updated equipment may also provide cost effective efficiency in the production process. In the same manner, consideration for water efficiency also reduces the overall pollution and resource profiles for an operation and it's operating costs. </div>
<div class="round_box3">Energy conservation and pollution prevention are complementary activities. That is, actions that conserve energy reduce the quantity of wastes produced by energy-generating processes, and actions that reduce production process wastes lower the expenditure of energy for waste handling and treatment.</div>

</div>

<div class="hori_div_area"><br><br>Water efficiency measures may include recycling of process water throughout an operation, or harvesting storm water on site and reusing as appropriate at the facility.  At present, there are no regulatory requirements for enterprises to develop pollution prevention and energy efficiency programs, and so it is left open to each enterprise to manage themselves.    <br><br></div>

<div class="hori_div_area">A pollution prevention and energy efficiency program is an ongoing, comprehensive examination of the operations at a facility with the goal of minimizing all types of waste products and reducing energy needs. Pollution prevention and energy efficiency at industrial facilities can be achieved through conservation of water, developing more efficient energy use, and reducing or eliminating the use of hazardous materials in an industrial process. 
<br><br>
<span class="bold">Pollution Prevention</span><br><br>

Pollution prevention can be achieved through replacing hazardous raw materials or inefficient technologies with the use of environmental friendly chemicals or more efficient technologies.
