<div class="hori_div_area">In order to provide the proper management and oversight needed to address the environmental aspects and impacts (risks and liabilities) of a facility’s operations, it is important that staff be aware of the environmental issues as they relate to their facility and their jobs, and that proper training be provided.  Specialized training is necessary for certain operations, such as operating an ETP or other treatment control equipment. Training on the safe management, handling and storage of use of hazardous materials and chemicals, and the safe management of wastes, are necessary to effectively manage the environmental risks of a facility’s operations.  There are at present no regulatory requirements by the DOE related to environmental training standards, so it is left open to each enterprise to manage appropriately.<br><br></div>

Overall Training – All Employees<br><br>
Proper environmental training and awareness is absolutely necessary for an organization to be able to manage its environmental risks in a responsible manner. All facility staff should receive general environmental awareness training so that they understand the importance of a clean and healthy, to themselves and others, and the role they can play in helping to achieve it through proper environmental management, awareness and controls.
<br><br>Specialized Training – Select Personnel <br><br>
Specialized training should be provided to all staff whose duties involve anything that may have an environmental impact including:

<div class="hori_div_area">
It is strongly recommended that as a best practice that one or more individuals (depending on size and complexity of operations) be assigned and dedicated to overseeing environmental management activities at a facility. This responsibility may also include worker health and safety, and/or social management, but it is important that dedicated staff directly oversee environmental responsibilities, and that these responsibilities are not diluted with too many other, non - environmental priorities. Such a dedicated environmental manager should also be periodically trained on the latest environmental management developments to keep his knowledge and skills up to date.  She/He should also oversee that the necessary training of other staff (e.g., treatment plant operator, staff who handle chemicals and hazardous materials) is up to date.

Environmental Training and Awareness Program in the Facilities at the DEPZ</span><br><br></div>

<div class="hori_div_area">

There are several enterprises (e.g. YKK, Youngone, Shanta, Avery Dennison, Grameen Knitwear, EOS Textile) at the DEPZ who have employed compliance staff, who often together with other compliance duties, are also responsible for conducting environmental management activities (such as monitoring, training and capacity building) of their respective enterprises.  Although many of the industries do not have compliance staff completely dedicated to environmental management, they sometimes provide environmental training for their staff and it is most likely that environmental concerns such as the use, handling and storage of chemicals and hazardous materials, safety procedures for working in areas of elevated noise, and ETP management are included in the health and safety issues and emergency response training. It is estimated that only four enterprises at the DEPZ provide resources for environmental training to their staff. The Youngone enterprises have training module, training program and training matrix and full time dedicated management for training and development.
